# web-blog
I have used html/css for front end, nodeJs for backend ,express framework for routing , mongoDb for databse.


Steps to run the application:
i)Download all the files in the web blog
ii)Add node_modules folder(as i was unable to upload it due to number of files in it)
iii)For installing nodeJs you can see online help like(w3schools.com)

    node app.js
    It will start the server then goto http://localhost:8080 the web page will open and all the features u can see how will it work.
